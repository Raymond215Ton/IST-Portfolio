	<h2>1.Introduction to the World Wide Web</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web is an information system where web resources such as documents are identified by Uniform Resource Locators(URLs) which may be linked by hypertext.  It is a collection of webpages that are found over the Internet. The Web works by having computers communicate with each other, where one computer, the web browser, sends a message to another computer, the web server. 
A web browser is a software application that is utilised in order to access information on the Internet. On the other hand, the web server on the physical side is a computer which stores web server software. A web server in its most basic form is a HTTP server but usually also includes several parts that dictate how web users can access hosted files. 
 </p>
	<h2>2.How is the World Wide Web different from the Internet?</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web is different from the internet in that the World Wide Web is the worldwide collection of text pages, digital photographs, music files, videos and animations that can be accessed via the Internet. However, the Internet is the global network of networks that consists of billions of computers and other devices that are interconnected. These connections include and are not restricted to World Wide Web, phone networks and television networks.  </p>
	<h2>What is an intranet? How is it similar or related to the internet?</h2>
	<p>An intranet is a local or restricted communications network, especially a private network created using World Wide Web software. It is designed to support an organisation’s employees and allow them to communicate, collaborate and perform their roles within the company. It is related to the internet in that it is a network that connects computers and people together. However, the intranet is different in that it is a private network that is  only connected to those within the system whereas the internet is the public network that connects all networks together. Login details are often required to access an intranet whereas the internet is free to use and doesn't require a password to access generally. </p>
	<h2>What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP, TCP and FTP.</h2>
	<p>An internet protocol is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data that traverses over the Internet are separated into smaller parts called packets. These packets have IP information attached to them and this information helps them go towards the correct destination. Once these packets arrive at their intended destination, they are sorted differently based on which transport protocol is utilised with the IP.</p> 

 <h2>Differences between http, tcp and ftp</h2>
<p>HTTP, also referred to as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the underlying protocol for the World Wide Web and determines how messages are formatted and transmitted as well as what actions web browsers and servers should take. HTTP is a stateless protocol because each command is performed individually, with no prior knowledge of the command that came before it.</p>

<p>TCP, also known as Transmission Control Protocol is a standard that establishes and defines how to maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.  TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which essentially means that a connection is established and kept going until the web browsers and servers cease exchanging messages. When a client requests a HTML file, the HTTP program layer will request the TCP layer to set up a connection and send the file. The TCP program will then divide the file into data packets and send them individually towards the client. The TCP program that is located within the client’s computer will analyse the data being transferred and make sure that the data is being sent in the correct order with no missing parts. If there is a missing part, the TCP program will then ask for the re-transmission of any data that it does not have based on missing packet numbers.</p>

<p>FTP, also known as  File Transfer Protocol is the protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and a server on a computer network. It is the procedure in which most files are transferred online. FTP is utilised when two computers with different configurations want to exchange data between them.</p>
<h2>Comparison</h2>
<ul>
	<li>HTTP establishes data connection only, while FTP establishes both data connection and control connection</li>
	<li>Both methods utilise TCP to ensure the secure connection and arrival of transmitted data. However, HTTP uses TCP port number 80 while FTP uses TCP ports number 20 and 21.</li>
	<li>HTTP does not require authentication while FTP requires authentication to perform the transfer of data.</li>
	<li>TCP is the protocol that is used by both HTTP and FTP to transmit data between two computers.</li>
</ul>
